Identifies if it is a cheetah, a leopard, or a jaguar by looking at their images. I always have trouble classifying between these three big cats, that's why I thought to make a classifier using deep-learning.

In this projects I created a dataset set by scrapping images from [Google Images](https://images.google.com). I have used about 300 images from each class. This project is inspired by lesson-2 of [fastai](http://course.fastai.com) course.

I have made a WebApp for this project with help of frontend template provided by [fastai](https://github.com/render-examples/fastai-v3).


## Live Demo
This WebApp is deployed on [Render](https://render.com) and can be found at [https://bigcats.onrender.com](https://bigcats.onrender.com)

## Local Installation

* Clone the repository

`$ git clone https://github.com/shashank2806/cheetah-leopard-jaguar.git`

* Install required libraries

`$ pip install -r requirements.txt`

* Then cd into cloned folder

`$ cd cheetah-leopard-jaguar`

* Run `server.py`

`$ python app/server.py serve`



## Contributing
All contributions to the project are welcome, You can Improve the accuracy of algorithm, or can make WebApp more beautiful and interactive.
