# Is it a Chhetah, Leopard or Jaguar?

Identifies if it is a cheetah, a leopard, or a jaguar by looking at their images. I always have trouble classifying between these three big cats, that's why I thought to make a classifier using deep-learning.

In this projects I created a dataset set by scrapping images from [Google Images](https://images.google.com). I have used about 300 images from each class. This project is inspired by lesson-2 of [fastai](http://course.fastai.com) course.

I have made a WebApp for this project with help of frontend template provided by [fastai](https://github.com/render-examples/fastai-v3).

I have deployed this WebApp on [Render](https://render.com) and can be found at [https://bigcats.onrender.com](https://bigcats.onrender.com)
